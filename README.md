## [Self-Host Guide](https://github.com/Common-Codes/self-host-monorepo/tree/main/shnitters)

**Advanced**
- If you're fine running Shnitters on the global instance, leave the code as-is. If not, change the backend (you may need to update some frontend features in the scripts, such as global names and/or locations, if you choose to use another backend other than Firebase)
- Most icons used from within Shnitters are hosted on `firebasestorage.googleapis.com`, stored as either `.png`, `.jpg` or `.webp`, but served as `webp` images. These images are licensed under the same License and apply to the same ToS as Shnitters. *Yes, you can freely use them on your own Shnitters frontend*

**Not only do we allow our users to create a custom frontend, we *recommend* it.**
