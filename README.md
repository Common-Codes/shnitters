Shnitters (former packed name: ShnittersPWA)

Open Source Twitter Platform with heavy JS reliability.

*name origin: Snickers (chocolate) + Twitter*

## To self-host
- Download the repo
- Deploy the repo on a VPS or any `localhost` webserver.
*note: it is not recommended to simply open and run the HTML file in a browser, as it will cause issues.

**Advanced**
- If you're fine running Shnitters on the global instance, leave the code as-is. If not, change the backend (you may need to update some frontend features in the scripts if you choose to use another backend other than Firebase)
