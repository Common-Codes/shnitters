Shnitters (former packed name: ShnittersPWA)

Open Source Twitter Platform with heavy JS reliability.

*name origin: Snickers (chocolate) + Twitter*

## To self-host
- Download the repo
- Deploy the repo on a VPS or any `localhost` webserver.
*note that it is not recommended to simply open and run the HTML file in a browser, as it will cause issues.*

**Advanced**
- If you're fine running Shnitters on the global instance, leave the code as-is. If not, change the backend (you may need to update some frontend features in the scripts, such as global names and/or locations, if you choose to use another backend other than Firebase)
- Most icons used from within Shnitters are hosted on `firebasestorage.googleapis.com`, stored as either `.png`, `.jpg` or `.webp`, but served as `webp` images. These images are licensed under the same License and apply to the same ToS as Shnitters. *Yes, you can freely use them on your own Shnitters frontend*

**Not only do we allow our users to create a custom frontend, we *recommend* it.**
